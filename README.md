# Spy's Monumenta Modpacks
**Spy's Monumenta Modpacks** are two separate modpacks created to enhance the experience of new and veteran players for the CTMMMORPG Minecraft server Monumenta. They take inspiration from [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive), [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), and [Noelle's Monumenta Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/noelles-monumenta-modpack). Both modpacks are licensed under CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International. Additionally, I am committed to using only open-source or source-available modifications for both the benefit of users and the advancement of FOSS ideals.

## Spy's Lightweight Monumenta
**[Spy's Lightweight Monumenta](https://modrinth.com/modpack/spys-lightweight-monumenta)** is a minimalist modpack for Monumenta containing the bare minimum for a fresh Fabric instance. It is meant to be as easy and bloat-free as possible for players unfamiliar with Minecraft modifications and Monumenta. If it is your first time installing a Fabric modpack, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Spy21DD/spys-monumenta-modpacks/wiki) for a step-by-step tutorial on how to set one up.

This modpack is in beta to reflect its possibly unstable nature, therefore I will be adding and removing mods/features as needed. A list of all mods and their associated metadata is available on the GitHub repository, which I am committed to keeping up to date.

## Spy's Full-Fat Monumenta
**Spy's Full-Fat Monumenta** contains all of the mods I personally use when playing on Monumenta. At the time of writing, it is currently a work in progress and has not been publicly released.

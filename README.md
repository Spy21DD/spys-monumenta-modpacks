# Spy's Monumenta Modpacks
**Spy's Monumenta Modpacks** are two separate modpacks created to enhance the experience of new and veteran players for the CTMMMORPG Minecraft server Monumenta. They take inspiration from [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) and [Noelle's Monumenta Modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/noelles-monumenta-modpack). Both modpacks are licensed under CC Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International. Additionally, I am committed to using only open-source or source-available modifications for both the benefit of users and the advancement of FOSS ideals.

## Spy's Lightweight Monumenta
**[Spy's Lightweight Monumenta](https://modrinth.com/modpack/spys-lightweight-monumenta)** is a minimalist modpack for Monumenta containing the bare minimum for a fresh Fabric instance. It is meant to be as easy and bloat-free as possible for players unfamiliar with Minecraft modifications and Monumenta. If it is your first time installing a Fabric modpack, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/Spy21DD/spys-monumenta-modpacks/wiki) for a step-by-step tutorial on how to set one up.

This modpack is in beta to reflect its possibly unstable nature and my commitment to continue updating the wiki when new issues arise.

## Spy's Full-Fat Monumenta
**Spy's Full-Fat Monumenta** contains all of the mods I personally use when playing on Monumenta. At the time of writing, it is currently a work in progress and has not been publically released.

## Acknowledgements
This repository does not contain any code or binary files of the constituent modifications to prevent licensing issues; rather it contains the configuration and metadata files that are packed into the .mrpack installation archive that I will update from time to time.
My thanks to Randy (oldstories) who gave me permission to use the original texture I used for the modpack icons and the Monumenta Resource Pack team as a whole for their work.
My thanks to mod, launcher, tool and other creators for their work on making Minecraft a better game for all.
